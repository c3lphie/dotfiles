* About my setup
I have for a long time wanted my own setup, that is exactly how I want it.
And I think i'm getting closer to this goal.

As of writing this README, most of my setup is based of Derek Taylors (DT) XMonad setup.
I do intent to find my own way, but his dotfiles and videos are an amazing resource which I will build upon.

** Goals
- Minimalism (or atleast as close as possible)
- Effeciency
- As open as possible (Open source > Proprietary)

* Software
